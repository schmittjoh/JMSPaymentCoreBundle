#JMSPaymentCoreBundle [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/schmittjoh/JMSPaymentCoreBundle.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/schmittjoh/JMSPaymentCoreBundle)

JMSPaymentCoreBundle provides the foundation for using different payment backends in Symfony projects. It abstracts away the differences between payment protocols and offers a simple and unified API for performing financial transactions.

Key Points:

- Simple, Unified API (integrate once, and use any payment provider)
- Persistence of Financial Entities (such as payments, transactions, etc.)
- Transaction Management including Retry Logic
- Encryption of Sensitive Data
- Supports [many](http://jmsyst.com/bundles/JMSPaymentCoreBundle/master/payment_backends) payment backends out of the box
